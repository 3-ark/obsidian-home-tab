# Obsidian Home tab
Obsidian Home tab is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that adds a browser-like home default new tab with a search bar and a grid of starred files.

You can search any local file in your vault, both markdown notes and attachments.

This plugin is not meant to be a replacement for the default Quick switcher or any alternative one like [Another quick switcher](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-another-quick-switcher) (from which I took inspiration), but rather a faster way to open a note or a file after opening a new tab.

## Features
### Filter search by file type or extension
To easily find a file you can filter the search by using filters for the file type or the file extension.

You can activate a filter by writing the filter key (see table below) and pressing tab. To remove the filter press backspace.

#### Filters keys
The following filters are available:

| File type | File extension | 
| :-: | :-: | 
| `markdown` | `md`|
| `image` | `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `svg`, `gif`, `bmp` | 
| `video` | `mp4`, `webm`, `ogv`, `mov`, `mkv` |
| `audio` | `mp3`, `wav`, `m4a`, `ogg`, `3gp`, `flac` |
| `pdf` | `pdf` |

### Starred files
If enabled, starred files are automatically displayed under the search bar.

You can unstar a file directly from the home tab view by hovering the top right corner.
